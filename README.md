# FunWithSwift
A collection of projects built to get a better understanding of Swift, Xcode, and iOS development. All projects are written in Swift 3.   

Inspired by [Allen Wang's](https://twitter.com/creativewang) [30 Days of Swift project](https://github.com/allenwong/30DaysofSwift), [Nash Vail's](https://twitter.com/NashVail) [X Days of Swift](https://github.com/nashvail/X-Days-of-Swift), and the countless others.
